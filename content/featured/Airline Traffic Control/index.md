The user view shows incoming/outgoing flights and their gate numbers. Employees can log in and access their designated areas, such as adding flights for airline employees and managing gates for airport employees. The admin can manage employee accounts and add new employees. The system assigns gate numbers to flights automatically and manages baggage carousel assignments efficiently. which is deployed in the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) environment and is equipped with an autoscaling load balancer to manage high traffic demands
